      <h2>University Data API Integration</h2>
      <p>This application integrates with a powerful university data API, offering a comprehensive view of higher education institutions. Imagine a vast repository containing information on countless universities across the globe, encompassing details like names, locations, programs offered, faculty expertise, research areas, and even student demographics. Such a large university data API unlocks a wealth of possibilities for exploration and analysis. It empowers users to discover universities that align with their academic interests, compare programs across institutions, or even conduct research on trends within higher education. While this application currently leverages a limited scope of the API, focusing on universities in the US, the potential for future expansion is vast. By harnessing the power of a large university data API, we can create innovative tools and resources that empower students, researchers, and educational institutions alike.</p>
